Ingredients

1 egg
3⁄4 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter or 2 tablespoons margarine, melted
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt

Directions

Beat egg until fluffy.

Add milk and melted margarine.

Add dry ingredients and mix well.

Heat a heavy griddle or fry pan which is greased with a little butter on a
paper towel.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water breaks into several
smaller balls which 'dance' around the pan.

Pour a small amount of batter (approx 1/4 cup) into pan and tip to spread out
or spread with spoon. When bubbles appear on surface and begin to break, turn
over and cook the other side.
